# Introduction

Trello is a great tool for collaboration at free style. It’s a good thing especially you want to encourage a-synchronize communication which is a key to focus.

A true develop team has culture; to us, it’s Scrum.  Trello doesn’t provide trivial way to add up all tasks estimations and aggregate them together. We need a way to track our burn rate, therefore TrelloLight is born.

# TrelloLight (TrafficLight) will…

1.	Enforce task estimation. Unestimated tasks are shown in red. You should either put it back to the **Backlog** to be done in the next sprint, or append an estimation:

	>	“Apply pinch gesture to photo gallery (4.5)

2.	Show **Remaining Hours**, the only index you need to know for a sprint or show to your boss. Remaining hours will stay next to the board title for everyone to see.  It also provides real time feedback to any updates in the current sprint, so as to provide a better understanding about how little steps effect final result.

# Using TrelloLight

[Download TrelloLight extension](https://github.com/waveface/TrelloLight/downloads) and install it.  Refresh [Trello](http://trello.com/).

To track your burned hours, you need to create a list named **Done** exactly and put all finished cards here.
