Introduction
============

Trello is a great tool for collaboration at free style. It’s a good thing especially you want to encourage a-synchronize communication which is a key to focus.

A true develop team will have it’s culture, to us, it’s Scrum. Trello doesn’t provide trivial way to add up all tasks estimations and aggregate them together. We need a way to track our burn rate, therefore TrelloLight is born.

TrelloLight (TrafficLight) will
===========

1. Enforce tasks estimation. The task will become red if there’s no estimate. You should either put it in next sprint (backlog) or give it one, like this “Apply pinch gesture to photo gallery (4.5H)”.

2. Remaining hours, the only index you need to know for a sprint or show to your boss. Remaining hours will stay next to board title, any team member / Scrum Master can monitor (attach to) it. It also provides real time feedback to any update in current sprint to have a better understanding about how little steps effect final result.
